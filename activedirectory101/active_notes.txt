so we begin by doing an nmap scan and we obtain the results

we enum port 135 but there is really nothing much over there.... so we move to smb(port 445) where using enum4linux we see that we have both access of reading and listing  files over the Replication share... 



smbclient //10.10.10.100/Replication                             
Password for [WORKGROUP\isayar17_x401a]:
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> RECURSE ON
smb: \> PROMPT OFF
smb: \> mget *


so what happens is the the recurse on allows smbclient to traverse in the share... including subdirectories... directories... and includes all files in the file transfer operation.... 

for the prompt off it disables the interactive prompts during the file transfer while mget * initiates the file transfer operation and retrieves all files() in the current directory from the SMB server to the local machine.

so using the command smbclient //10.10.10.100/Replication -N -c "cd active.htb/Policies/{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}/MACHINE/Preferences/Groups; get Groups.xml" -t 15 

I was ale to download the file the reason i began with cd was to first of all be in the remote file path so that I can download the file in the local file path because get does not support downloading just using the remote file path...


after downloading it I learned something about GPP(Group Policy Preferences) which was introduced in Windows Server 2008 to help administrators modify settings belonging to users and groups across the network... one particular use case was to change the password for the local admin account on multiple machines... 

To do so the admins would define the new password in the GPP settings and store it in a file called Groups.xml the password was encrypted using the AES-256 Encryption Algorithm... but the Microsoft Developer Network unintentionally released the encryption algorithm of the AES-256 Encryption Algorithm... back in 2012 which made it simple to decrypt and obtain the password

so using gppdecrypt I got the password as GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 for the user SVC_TGS 

a classic case of kerberosting whereby I will be retrieving the TGS and cracking it to obtain the password... the TGS contains the NTLM Hash  that can be cracked too..... but  inorder we get the TGS we need to identify the service principal name for the account

impacket-GetUserSPNs active.htb/SVC_TGS:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -dc-ip 10.10.10.100  -request

the getUserSPNs does not only retrieve the SPNS that have been configured for the users in the domain but it also retrieves the hash of the spn that we retrieve...The spn belongs to Administrator... and the hash also belongs to the Administrator so we crack the hash and we get the password as Ticketmaster1968â€‹ ... This is a jackpot...


using:

impacket-wmiexec active.htb/administrator:Ticketmaster1968@10.10.10.100


we get access as administrator...
